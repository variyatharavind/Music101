# Music101

Music101 was my high school project. It combines two of my interests, Music and Coding, to create a fun learning platform for beginner musicians by showing them about the various scales and chords in an interactive manner using GUI.

To understand how music is made we need to know a bit of musical theory. The basics of music lie within a set of 12 notes with different pitches. From these 12, different notes can be used to form a pattern. These patterns are known as scales (ragas). In music, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. Apart from scales there is another concept known as chords which is a smaller set of notes derived from each scale. Though there are some rules in forming such patterns, the total number of scales that exist are more than 150 and the number of chords that can be formed from this are thousands! It is almost impossible for even the greatest musicians to remember these many number of scales and chords.

This is where this application comes to help. By just choosing the scale the pianist wants to know about, the application gives the notes of that scale and also illustrates it on a virtual keyboard. The application can also tell which scale the pianist is playing on by selecting the notes he thinks is in that scale. Similarly, the application can select and identify chords which the pianist desires.

In a guitar, there is no specific pattern to identify scales like in a piano or keyboard; it only depends on the length of the vibrating string whose positions are to be memorized. Guitarists too face the problem of remembering innumerous chords and this application serves them in that purpose.
